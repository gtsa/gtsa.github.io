Inception is my personal portfolio website. It was created to highlight my skills and experience as a Full Stack Web and Software Developer, with a special focus on software development. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed and developed a responsive website that is easy to navigate and visually appealing. The website is served by Nginx web server software, ensuring high performance and stability. Visitors can find information about my background, education, and experience, as well as a selection of my projects. The website is SEO & Speed Optimized, and designed to work on various screen sizes and devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, using media queries and responsive design. It also includes a working Ajax contact form, allowing for easy communication with potential employers or clients. The contact form is secured by a CAPTCHA, which helps to prevent spam and bots, allowing for only legitimate inquiries to reach me.
